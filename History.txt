=== 0.0.5 / 2009-09-02

   The following variables are now exposed: $request_method,
   $content_length and $content_type.  Additionally, attempts
   to use $http_content_length or $http_content_type will be
   remapped to use the non-"$http_"-prefixed variable instead
   since the "$http_"-variants of those variables is not allowed
   by Rack.

=== 0.0.4 / 2009-09-02

    The pure Ruby version now escapes with uppercase A-F
    characters to match nginx log output.  There are now extra
    checks against badly behaving Rack applications and 500
    errors will be logged before TypeError is raised if the
    application response does not conform (minimally) to Rack
    expectations.  Finally, handling of $request (requests
    without "HTTP_VERSION" set in the Rack env) should now be
    logged correctly without unnecessary trailing characters.

    Hackers: the primary git repository has been moved to
    git://git.bogomips.org/clogger.git for now since I'm having
    issues with pushing to Rubyforge (seems related to Support
    Requests item #26185).

=== 0.0.3 / 2009-08-29

    The MRI extension clogger_ext gets GC bug fix and
    cleanups/robustness improvements.  It should now be more
    tolerant of misbehaving applications in that it'll be less
    likely to segfault.  No changes to the (recommended) pure
    implementation.
